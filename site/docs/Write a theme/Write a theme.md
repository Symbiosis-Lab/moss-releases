How to take a site from stock to styled.

## Where your files go

Put your custom CSS and JavaScript here:

```
my-site/
├── .moss/
│   └── theme/
│       ├── style.css
│       └── script.js
├── index.md
└── ...
```

moss serves `.moss/theme/` verbatim to `/_moss/theme/` in the built site. Both files load automatically on every page. No build step, no config entry.

## How your CSS wins

moss loads **`.moss/theme/style.css`** into the last CSS layer (`@layer themes`). It wins over all of moss's built-in styles by layer order. No `!important` needed. No `@layer` needed.

## The three styling rungs

Work at the level that matches what you're changing.

### Token override

Change a CSS custom property and every component that uses it follows:

```css
:root {
  --moss-color-accent: #2d5a2d;
  --moss-font-body: "Inter", -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --moss-content-width: 72ch;
}
```

Use this rung for colors, fonts, spacing, and width — anything that should be consistent across the whole site.

### CSS selector on semantic HTML

Target moss's stable class names for component-level changes. moss emits `.moss-collection-card`, `.moss-article-listing`, `.moss-colophon`, and many others. Target them directly:

```css
.moss-collection-card {
  border-radius: 0;
}
```

The full list is in [[components|Component classes]].

### Named-class fenced div

Attach a custom class to a shortcode block with `{.class}` syntax, then target the combination:

```markdown
:::grid 3 {.profiles}
...
:::
```

```css
.profiles .moss-grid-card {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

Use this rung for one-off layout variations on a single page.

## Dark mode

moss sets `data-theme` on `<html>` before first paint. It reads `localStorage["moss-theme"]` and falls back to the OS `prefers-color-scheme`. One block in your stylesheet covers both the toggle and the system preference.

Do not write `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Write this instead, which applies whenever dark mode is active regardless of how the visitor arrived there:

```css
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --moss-color-bg: #0f0f0f;
  --moss-color-accent: #6abf6a;
}
```

## Quiet chrome

`--moss-color-ui-accent` controls nav links, buttons, and site controls. It defaults to `var(--moss-color-accent)`, tying navigation color to your content accent. To make the chrome recede while content links keep the accent, set it to a neutral:

```css
:root {
  --moss-color-ui-accent: var(--moss-color-text);
}
```

## Self-hosted fonts

Drop `.woff2` files in `.moss/theme/fonts/` and reference them from `style.css`:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "MyFont";
  src: url("fonts/myfont.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

For JavaScript, moss sets `window.mossTheme.base` to the `/_moss/theme/` URL before `script.js` runs. Resolve assets against it:

```javascript
const url = new URL("asset.woff2", mossTheme.base);
```

## Where to find every token and class

For the full set:

- [[css-tokens|CSS tokens]] — every `--moss-*` custom property, grouped by category
- [[components|Component classes]] — every `.moss-*` class name moss emits
- [[html-structure|HTML structure]] — the DOM skeleton and data attributes
- Run `moss describe --json` for the live values of your installed moss
